# Sales Records Bug Fix Summary

## Problem
Sales records created for newly created businesses were not displaying in the operations route (`/operations`), but they were correctly showing in the accounting route (`/accounting`).

## Root Cause
The issue was in the business context management between the two routes:

1. **Operations Route**: Used `SalesRecordService.getRecordsForDate()` and `getSalesSummary()` methods that relied on `getCurrentBusinessId()` from the global business context inside the service methods.

2. **Accounting Route**: Used `AccountingService.getAllTransactions()` which calls `SalesRecordService.getRecordsByBusiness()` and explicitly passes the business ID as a parameter.

The problem occurred because the operations route relied on the global business context being properly initialized and synchronized, while the accounting route explicitly passed the business ID, making it more reliable.

## Solution
Updated the `SalesRecordService` methods to accept an optional `businessId` parameter and modified the operations route to pass the business ID explicitly, following the same pattern as the accounting route.

## Files Modified

### 1. `src/lib/services/salesRecordService.ts`
- Added optional `businessId` parameter to:
  - `getRecordsForDate(saleDate, branchId?, businessId?)`
  - `getSalesSummary(saleDate, branchId?, businessId?)`
  - `getRecordsForDateRange(startDate, endDate, branchId?, businessId?)`
  - `getHourlySalesData(saleDate, branchId?, businessId?)`

### 2. `src/components/operations/SalesRecordingInterface.tsx`
- Updated calls to pass `currentBusinessId` explicitly:
  - `SalesRecordService.getRecordsForDate(selectedDate, selectedBranch || undefined, currentBusinessId)`
  - `SalesRecordService.getSalesSummary(selectedDate, selectedBranch || undefined, currentBusinessId)`

### 3. `src/components/operations/AnalyticsDashboard.tsx`
- Updated call to pass `currentBusinessId`:
  - `SalesRecordService.getRecordsForDateRange(filters.startDate, filters.endDate, filters.branchId || undefined, currentBusinessId)`

### 4. `src/hooks/useSalesRecords.ts`
- Updated calls to pass `currentBusinessId`:
  - `SalesRecordService.getRecordsForDate(date, branchId, currentBusinessId)`
  - `SalesRecordService.getSalesSummary(date, branchId, currentBusinessId)`

## Benefits
1. **Consistency**: Both operations and accounting routes now use the same pattern for business context handling
2. **Reliability**: Explicit business ID passing eliminates timing issues with global context
3. **Maintainability**: Clear parameter passing makes the code easier to understand and debug
4. **Backward Compatibility**: The changes are backward compatible - existing calls without business ID still work

## Testing
To verify the fix:
1. Create a new business
2. Switch to the new business
3. Record a sale for the current date
4. Check that the sale appears in both:
   - Operations route (`/operations`) - Sales Recording tab
   - Accounting route (`/accounting`) - Recent Transactions

Both routes should now show the same sales data for the newly created business.
